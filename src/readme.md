# App source

This folder contains almost all the source code for the front-end app. These are mostly React components that are compiled into a single JS file and sent to the user's browser (along with whatever's in [`/public`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/public))

**See the [SpiritualGifts guide: How It Works](http://getspiritualGifts.org/#how-it-works)**

- [`/src/index.js`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/index.js) - Create React App will use this file as a starting point for compiling your whole front-end app. All `index.js` does is set up Firebase, initialize tracking services like Google Analytics, and use React to render the main `<App>` component.
- [`/src/actions`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/actions) - plain old javascript functions for changing app data or state, like loging out or create a post (similar to MVC "controllers")
- [`/actions/helpers/firestoreHelpers.js`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/blob/master/src/actions/helpers/firestoreHelpers.js) - some helpers that can add timestamps etc before documents are written to the database
- [`/src/styles`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/styles) - style-only react components for use in your views (replaces your CSS/SASS files)
- [`/src/views`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/views) - react components that show your app's UI ("views" in MVC)
- [`/src/views/App.js`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/views/App.js) - The main React component of our app. `App.js` renders our page layout, some wrapper components for Firestore and React Router, and our `Routes.js` file
- [`/src/views/Routes.js`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/views/Routes.js) - Each route renders one of our app's main pages
- [`/src/views/layout/Layout.js`](https://github.com/sampl/spiritualGifts/tree/master/src/views/layout/Layout.js) - Global app layout that appears on each page
